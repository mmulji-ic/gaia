Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups. Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission. https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum. It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. The question on this proposal is \u201cAre validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?\u201d.

It means there is no record of discussion that voters can confidently point to for context, potentially leading to governance decisions becoming delegitimized by stakeholders.\\n\\nThe requested amount will be sent to a multisig comprising individuals (members listed below) who can ensure that the tokens are spent judiciously. We believe stewardship of the forum requires:\\n\\n* **Moderation**: Format, edit, and categorize posts; Standardize titles and tags; Monitor and approve new posts; Archive posts.\\n* **Facilitation**: Ask clarifying questions in post threads; Summarize discussions; Provide historical precedence to discussions.\\n* **Engagement**: Circulate important posts on other social channels to increase community participation; Solicit input from key stakeholders.\\n* **Guidance**: Orient and assist newcomers; Guide proposers through governance process; Answer questions regarding the forum or Cosmos ecosystem.\\nThe work to steward the forum will be carried out by members of [Hypha Worker Co-op](https://hypha.coop/) and individuals selected from the community to carry out scoped tasks in exchange for ATOM from this budget.\\n## Multisig Members\\n* Hypha: Mai Ishikawa Sutton (Hypha Co-op)\\n* Validator: Daniel Hwang (Stakefish)\\n* Cosmos Hub developer: Lauren Gallinaro (Interchain Berlin)\\n\\nWe feel the membership of the multisig should be rotated following the six-month pilot period to preserve insight from the distinct specializations (i.e., Cosmos Hub validators and developers).\\n## Timeline and Deliverables\\nWe estimate the total work to take 250-300 hours over six months where we hope to produce:\\n* **Moving summaries:** Provide succinct summaries of the proposals and include all publicly stated reasons why various entities are choosing to vote for/against a given proposal. These summaries will be written objectively, not siding with any one entity.\\n* **Validator platforms:** Create a section of the Forum where we collate all validators\' visions for Cosmos Hub governance to allow them to state their positions publicly. We will work with the smaller validators to ensure they are equally represented.\\n* **Regular check-ins with the Cosmonaut DAO:** Collaborate with the future Cosmonaut DAO to ensure maximal accessibility and engagement. Community management is a critical, complementary aspect of increasing participation in governance.\\n* **Announcement channel:** Create a read-only announcement channel in the Cosmos Community Discord, so that new proposals and major discussions can be easily followed.\\n* **Tooling friendly posts:** Tag and categorize posts so that they can be easily ingested into existing tooling that validators have setup.\\n* **Neutral moderation framework:** Document and follow transparent standards for how the forum is moderated.\\n\\nAt the end of the period, we will produce a report reflecting on our successes and failures, and recommendations for how the work of maintaining a governance venue can be continuously sustained (e.g., through a DAO). We see this initiative as a process of discovery, where we are learning by doing.\\n\\nFor more context, you can read through the discussions on this [proposal on the Discourse forum](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-activate-governance-discussions-on-the-discourse-forum-using-community-pool-funds/5833).\\n\\n## Governance Votes\\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\\n**YES** - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 1000 ATOM to a multisig that will spend them to improve governance discussions in the Discourse forum.\\n**NO** - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form (please indicate why in the Cosmos Forum).\\n**NO WITH VETO** - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.\\n**ABSTAIN** - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\\n## Recipient\\ncosmos1xf2qwf6g6xvuttpf37xwrgp08qq984244952ze\\n## Amount\\n1000 ATOM\\n\\n***Disclosure**: Hypha has an existing contract with the Interchain Foundation focused on the testnet program and improving documentation.
